That's where <a href="http://warfareplugins.com" rel="friend" title="Social Warfare">Social Warfare</a> can help.

= Social Warfare Sharing Options, Custom Design and Placements =

Social Warfare allows you to customize what sharing buttons you offer, how your buttons look and where they show up.

You can choose to have only a couple sharing options, or you can give readers the entire kitchen sink if you want. The point is, you get to decide which sharing options are available to your visitors.

You can choose from 6 different button shapes, 8 different color themes <strong>plus</strong> the ability to choose custom colors for your buttons. The design combinations are <em>unlimited</em>.

You can also choose where you want the buttons to show up. Choose To have your buttons show up:

* Above the post content
* Below the post content
* Both above and below the post content
* None (or) Manual placement

We also give you the ability to have floating share buttons follow your readers down the screen when static (non-floating) buttons are not in view. This way the reader will always have easy access to your share buttons, no matter where they scroll on your page.

= Powerful Share Customization =

Social Warfare is among the pioneers of customizing how your content is shared, particularly with Pinterest. It allows you to decide exactly what image, title and description shows up when your link is shared on sites like Facebook and Google+ or other sites that use Open Graph data for social shares.

On top of that, you can upload a <strong>custom Pinterest image</strong> (that wont even be visible on the page) and write a custom description so that when someone clicks the pin button, the exact image you've chosen shows up with exactly the description you've written. No more hoping that your readers choose the best image and write an optimal description for you!

We used it one of our co-founders's blogs, <a href="http://dustn.tv/" rel="friend" title="dustn.tv | Social Media and Creativity Collide">dustn.tv</a>, and increased Pinterest traffic by over *2,000%*.

In addition to that, you can also write a custom tweet for when someone clicks on the Twitter button. Social Warfare will automatically add your @username to the end of every tweet.

These capabilities are what professional social media marketers and bloggers have been waiting for. But don't just take our word. See what one of the experts are saying:

= Social Proof =

Proudly display how many times your content has been shared-- <strong>even tweet counts<strong>! Social Proof is a powerful psychological tool that has been proven to influence even more shares.

And if you would prefer to only show counts after a certain minimum number of shares has been met (to avoid "negative social proof"), you can do that as well. Or if you'd rather just have no counts showing at all, just turn them off altogether.

= Share Recovery: Your Lost Share Counts Returned! =

Have you ever changed permalink structures, domain prefixes, connection protocols (http-https) or just flat out changed domains and ended up <strong>losing all your social share counts?</strong>

We've built a tool right into Social Warfare called <a href="https://warfareplugins.com/support/recover-social-share-counts-after-changing-permalink-settings/" rel="friend" title="Share Recovery">Share Recovery</a> which allows you to get back your lost share counts if you've ever had to modify your permalink settings.

= Popular Posts Widget based on Social Share Counts =

Wouldn't you love to show what your most popular posts are based on the number of social shares's they've received? Social Warfare allows you to do just that.

You can even choose to display most popular posts on a specific social network!

Social Warfare's Popular Posts widget allows you to display and customize the look with:

* Post thumbnail images
* Image and text size
* Custom visual themes
* Custom date range

You can even decide to highlight posts that are popular with specific social networks.

= Use Shortcodes to Manually Place Share Buttons Anywhere =

If you want to place buttons in the middle of an article, you can absolutely do that with our shortcode. How about adding share buttons in a page that actually share out a different page altogether (like a "Thank You" page with share buttons that share the "Subscribe" page)? You can do that as well!

If you're experienced with PHP, you can also easily hook Social Warfare into your theme templates for hyper customization.

= Click to Tweet Quotes =

A simple and effective way to create tweetable quotes right inside your posts or pages. This has proven to increase the average number of tweets per article dramatically.

With 6 different Click to Tweet styles and an option to create your own style via your theme's CSS, the sky is the limit.

= Social Authorship, Twitter Cards, Rich Pins and More =

It nice to have your stuff shared on social media, it's even nicer when you get mentioned in the social share! With Social Warfare you can ensure that your authorship is always in place, including:

* Facebook author and publisher attribution
* Facebook app link (advanced users)
* Twitter publisher and author attribution
* "via @username" added to the ends of tweets
* "via @username" added to the ends of pin descriptions

You can also activate Twitter Cards (Large Image Cards) so that tweets sent from your site are always media rich and much more likely to get engagement.

Our plugin also ensures that your site is Rich Pin ready so that your Pins look as good as possible.
