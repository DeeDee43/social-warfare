# Warfare Plugins / Social Warfare Repository and Issue Tracker
This is a public repository for the Social Warfare WordPress plugin created primarily for the purpose of publishing and maintaining a public list of bugs, known issues, and feature requests with the community at large. Please use the "Issues" link above to track or add information to existing issues or to submit new issues altogether.

## Guidelines for Submutting Issues to this GitHub Issue Tracker
Before submitting an issue to the issue tracker, please be sure of a few things. By following these guidelines, you maximize the possibility of our development team being able to find a solution to the issue in a quick and thorough manner.

### Prerequisites: Do this BEFORE submitting an issue

#### 1. Check the Documentation
First check the [support documentation](https://warfareplugins.com/support/) on the Warfare Plugins website to ensure that a solution to your issue has not already been addressed. Once you've determined that there is no useful information for your particular issue, you may proceed to step 2.

#### 2. Submit a Support Ticket First
Once you have completed step 1, you need to submit a ticket using the [contact form on the Warfare Plugins website](https://warfareplugins.com/). Once submitted, most tickets are responded to on the same or next business day so please allow until the end of the next business day for a response. 

Many tickets being posted here are issues that simply require adjusting a single setting to accomodate themes or plugins in certain ways. The support team is able to respond to these much, much more quickly than here in the developer's workspace. Since this is the case, any issues submitted without first going through the support team will be deleted. Otherwise it is a waste of both your time and ours. 

#### 3. Create an Issue on GitHub
Only once you have completed the above steps should you submit an issue to GitHub. GitHub is the workspace of the development team. In the rare instances where the support team is unable to solve a particular issue, it will be brought here to be tracked and solved by the development team. GitHub is public so that not only the support team, but also all users can view and track the progress of issues as well as commenting and participating in the conversation regarding each issue.

### Required Information: Provide this information WHILE submitting an issue
