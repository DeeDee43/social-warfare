# Warfare Plugins / Social Warfare Repository and Issue Tracker
This is a public repository for the Social Warfare WordPress plugin created primarily for the purpose of publishing and maintaining a public list of bugs, known issues, and feature requests with the community at large. Please use the "Issues" link above to track or add information to existing issues or to submit new issues altogether.

## Guidelines for Submutting Issues to this GitHub Issue Tracker
Before submitting an issue to the issue tracker, please be sure of a few things. By following these guidelines, you maximize the possibility of our development team being able to find a solution to the issue in a quick and thorough manner.

### Prerequisites
#### Submit a Support Ticket First
First submit a ticket using the contact form on the Warfare Plugins website. Once submitted, most tickets are responded to on the same or next business day so please allow until the end of the next business day for a response. 

Many tickets being posted here are issues that simply require adjusting a single setting to accomodate themes or plugins in certain ways. The support team is able to respond to these much, much more quickly than here in the developer's workspace. Since this is the case, any issues submitted without first going through the support team will be deleted. Otherwise it is a waste of both your time and ours. 

### Required Information
Once you've gone through support and you're ready to submit a GitHub issue, please copy and paste the following information into your GitHub issue and fill out the blanks:
